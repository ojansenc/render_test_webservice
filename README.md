## Backend

On the command line, navigate to the `backend` directory. Create a new Python environment in your choice - either Anaconda or virtualenv with Python version as 3.8.5. 

Install the dependencies (inside the `backend` directory):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file inside the `backend` in the following format:

```
SECRET_KEY='...'
DB_USER='YOUR POSTGRES USERNAME'
DB_PASSWORD='YOUR POSTGRES PASSWORD'
```
The secret key is a Django key that is typically autogenerated. To get a secret key for yourself, run the following command and copy and paste the outputted key into the `.env` file for the `SECRET_KEY` field.

```
python -c 'from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())'
```
If the command does not work, verify that you are running in your virtual environment and you have installed the Django library.

Verify the server runs:
```
python manage.py runserver
```

Visit the local host URL to see the server running. 
## Frontend

Download and set up npm and Node.js:
https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

Navigate to the `frontend` directory on the command line.
Install the following dependencies:
```
npm install
```
You can ignore any vulnerablitity issues for now. To validate the installation, start the frontend:
```
npm start
```
See the URL printed out in console to see the React basic app. 
To learn more about React see the auto-generated `README` in the `frontend` directory.
